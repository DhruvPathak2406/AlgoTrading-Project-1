# Forecast Quant - An Algorithmic Trading System
This project is a simple algorithmic day-trading engine built in Python. It focuses on fetching market data, generating buy/sell signals, and testing intraday trading logic. The goal is to build a reliable foundation for experimenting with trading strategies and eventually running them live. This repo is mainly for learning algo-trading concepts such as indicators, backtesting, and designing intraday trading rules. It will be improved over time as new ideas and strategies are developed.
# How It Works?

  * Load live or historical market data

  * Apply a chosen strategy to generate trading signals

  * Evaluate how the strategy performs through simple backtesting

  * Extend and refine the logic based on results

# Tech Stack

  * Python 3

  * pandas, numpy

  * yfinance / broker API

  * matplotlib

  * scikit-learn
